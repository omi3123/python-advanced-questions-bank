"""
Given two positive integers m (width) and n (height), fill a two-dimensional list (or array) of size m-by-n in the following way:
All the elements in the first and last row and column are 1.
All the elements in the second and second-last row and column are 2, excluding the elements from step 1.
All the elements in the third and third-last row and column are 3, excluding the elements from the previous steps.
And so on â€¦
Example: 
Given m = 10, n = 9, your function should return
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],
 [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1], 
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1], 
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1], 
 [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1], 
 [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
